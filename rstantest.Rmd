
## This code copied from 

https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/09/introduction-to-stan-in-r/

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rstan)
library(rstanarm)

mtcars %>%
  head()
```


```{r}
predictors <- mtcars %>%
  select(-mpg)

stan_data <- list(
    N = 32,
    K = 10,
    X = predictors,
    y = mtcars$mpg
  )
```

```{r}
fit_rstan <- stan(
  file = "mtcars.stan",
  data = stan_data
)
fit_rstan
```
 
 
Finally got it workign by first removing rstan and stanheaders and following instructions at web site.
